<p> 
    I created a Flash Chat app, which is a real massaging app like WhatsApp or Facebook messenger. 
    I used Java, XML, and google Firebase database for storing user SMS and credentials. 
    I developed this app using the android studio.

    <P> 

            I created WorkForce web API for unemployment employee who is looking for a job. 
            The WorkForce API is securely accessing unemployed employee data from AWS-RDS database. 
            the potential customer of the WorkForce is an employer, but it can be consumed for many deferent purposes. 

            For developing WorkForce, I used these technologies, C#, .Net Core2.1, AWS-RDS, swagger, JSON, XML, Postman, Apigee API management platform, and hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

        My group member implements WorkForce API through making console application.
