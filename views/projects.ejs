   I created a Flash Chat app, which is a real massaging app like WhatsApp or Facebook messenger. 
   For creating this app, I used Java, XML, and google Firebase database for storing user SMS and credentials. 
   I developed this app using the android studio. I developed this project by myself and the purpose of this 
   app to create something comparable to Facebook massager.

    I created a WorkForce web API for unemployment educated people who are looking for a job. 
    The WorkForce API is securely accessing unemployed employee data from AWS-RDS database. The potential customer
     of the WorkForce is an employer, but it can be consumed for many different purposes. For developing WorkForce,
      I used these technologies, C#.Net Core2.1, AWS-RDS, swagger, JSON, XML, Postman, Apigee API management
       platform, and hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. My role was creating API, documenting, testing and securing
        API through Apigee API Security management.
